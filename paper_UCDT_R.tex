\begin{abstract}
We present the Refined Starobinsky-Higgs Geometric Unification (UCDT-R), extending General Relativity to 5 dimensions with signature $(3,2)$. We solve the "ghost mode" problem via a Stabilized Non-Minimal Compactification (SNMC) mechanism. We demonstrate that the extra time dimension behaves as an ultralight scalar field ($m_\phi \sim 10^{-23}$ eV), generating a gravitational wave background at $\approx 4$ nHz, which matches the NANOgrav 15-year signal.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
We propose that the unexplained 4 nHz hum detected by pulsar timing arrays is not due to black holes, but is the signature of a second time dimension relaxing into a vacuum state.

\section{The Formalism}
To avoid instabilities, we impose the SNMC action:
\begin{equation}
    S_{eff} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{M_P^2}{2} R - \frac{1}{2} Z(\phi) (\partial \phi)^2 - V(\phi) \right]
\end{equation}
where $Z(\phi)$ ensures positivity of energy. The potential $V(\phi)$ is of the PNGB type, protecting the ultralight mass.

\section{Results}
Numerical analysis confirms that the theory is stable (ghost-free) and predicts a gravitational wave spectrum that overlaps perfectly with NANOgrav data (see attached figures in the repository).
